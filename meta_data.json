    "plugin_instructions": "1.) Add the \"PDF Document Merger\" element anywhere on your page.\n\n2.) In a workflow, use the Element Actions \"Merge Two PDFs using a PDF Document Merge\" or \"Merge All PDFs using a PDF Document Merge\" to trigger the merge. You'll need to define the urls of the PDFs and a filename. [Additional actions will come with updates; if you need more options, email me@nicholasrbarrow.com]\n\n3.) Use the workflow action \"When PDFDocumentMerger {x}\" has finished merging\" to schedule a download/save action for your file. \n\nUPDATES\n[2.1.0] (1/2): Direct download is now a native feature -> no longer a need for a third-party plugin; (2/2): ability to generate the merged files WITHOUT saving to database (to reduce file clutter in the File Manager). \n"
