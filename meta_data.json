    "plugin_instructions": "1.) Add the \"PDF Document Merger\" element anywhere on your page.\n\n2.) In a workflow, use the Element Actions \"Merge Two PDFs using a PDF Document Merge\" or \"Merge All PDFs using a PDF Document Merge\" to trigger the merge. You'll need to define the urls of the PDFs and a filename. [Additional actions will come with updates; if you need more options, email me@nicholasrbarrow.com]\n\n3.) Use the workflow action \"When PDFDocumentMerge {x}\" has finished merging\" to schedule a download/save action for your file. Please note, downloading is not included in this plugin; consider a plugin like AirDev's \"File Downloader\" (https://bubble.io/plugin/file-downloader-1539124824422x194279356396994560)."
